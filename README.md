NBARecap utilizes the NBAData Library (https://github.com/Hryo224/NBAData) to generate PDF's for Recap Summaries of NBA Games from the previous day.

The PDF's that are generated contain the Per-Quarter breakdown of the game for each team, the stat-line of each player, and the AP Article written for the game.
